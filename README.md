# jokinator
This application will fetch jokes from the JokeAPI at https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke.

## Why do we use Vue.js?
Since this was a smaller project, we wanted a framework that was easy to learn. We choose Vue for its easy learning curve and because one of the group members had used Vue before, so that easy learning curve was confirmed. We also choose Vue for its clear documentation. Vue also only weighs around 20KB, making it fast and flexible.
